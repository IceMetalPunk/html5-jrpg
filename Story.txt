Gemini is a nation split across two islands, Castor and Pollux, joined only by a single bridge with "Gemini Tower" in the middle (midgame "boss battle" location, so to speak). A century or two ago, creatures now known as "Spawn" began to appear on the islands; scientists' best guess is that they came from an alternate universe through some kind of weak point -- or Nexus -- between worlds, though no one knows for sure. What we do know is that the species of Spawn vary wildly in abilities, intelligence, and form, but that they can all be classified into one of several tribes and types. The types refer to what kinds of abilities they have, the tribes refer to their common ideologies, strategies in battle, and approaches to life. Once people figured out how to capture Spawn -- some consider this "enslavement" and have started a very strong anti-Spawn-capture movement -- they began using the Spawn for their own purposes, be they political, militaristic, or otherwise.

As time went on, partly accelerated by the appearance of Spawn, the two islands became highly economically disparate. Castor became an island of poverty and squalor, while Pollux became an island of technology, wealth, and luxury. To keep the populace from rebelling to the point of being impossible to contain, the Gemini government instituted a rewards program of sorts: anyone who can prove themselves useful to the country by capturing and utilizing Spawn successfully enough to best the most renowned commanders will be afforded relocation from Castor to Pollux, with all expenses paid for life in exchange for service to the Gemini Spawn Special Forces.

The player begins as a citizen of Castor whose mother is ill, but who cannot afford her treatment. They decide to complete their "Proof of Aptitude" (that "rewards program") in hopes that they can bring their mother to Pollux and save her. The game ensues from there.
