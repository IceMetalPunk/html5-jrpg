"Gemini: Spawn of Castor" / "Gemini: Spawn of Pollux"

Every Spawn has both a tribe and a type. Types determine strengths and weaknesses, tribes determine main strategies. Every tribe can get every strategy of move, but they focus more on two strategies than others. Every type can get almost every other type of move, but they do get the equivalent of STAB for using same-type moves. A move has a type, but not a tribe, though the effects of the move may fit it into one tribe or another inherently.

Each spawn can wear up to 4 pieces of armor and have 1 or 2 held items; think of them as Minecraft equipment slots.

--------------------------

TRIBES:

Vampiric Tribe:
Primary focus: Draining Moves, stat lowering
Secondary focus: Conversion moves (whatever that means: swapping their spawn for yours? Changing types?)

Trickster Tribe:
Primary focus: Symmetric or random status moves (confusion, stat swapping, shuffling a team's position, etc.)
Secondary focus: Preaction moves (i.e. "becomes priority if opponent chooses a certain type of move")

Rogue Tribe:
Primary focus: Evasion moves (lower accuracy, raise stealth, invisibility, etc.)
Secondary focus: "Always hit" moves and moves that bypass protections

Militia Tribe:
Primary focus: Voltron - get extra buffs from armor and weapons
Secondary focus: Preplanning - Moves that allow you to sequence them two or more turns in advance

Support Tribe:
Primary focus: Healing and buffing (itself, allies, etc.)
Secondary focus: Protection effects, blocking opponent moves

-------------------

Types:
Mind, Body, Specter (supernatural creatures), Nature, Artifice

A non-transitive loop for balance (explanations thanks to SapphireFlame on Stack Exchange!):

Artifice > Mind > Specter > Body > Nature > Artifice

Artifice > Mind: The Mind type messes with others' brains directly, so have a natural disadvantage against Artifice types who use advanced technology that augments their brains in ways Mind types aren't adapted to working with.

Mind > Specter: Specter types don't have very solid physical bodies, meaning they are mostly just minds loosely holding particles together with self-directed psychic powers. Mental manipulation can therefore easily target them and also disrupt their entire being.

Specter > Body: Specters have a natural advantage against Body types mainly because they rely on raw strength and physical attacks which go through the Specters' loose physical form (like trying to punch a cloud).

Body > Nature: Nature types have low resistance against brute force attacks as they rely on external sheilding often far from themselves as opposed to actual worn armor, and don't generally build their own bodies up. Body types can generally shrug off terrain manipulation attacks (which would boil down to being fairly physical such as rock smashes and earth spikes) and plant-based attacks (they can rip through them), and their big bulk should withstand wind attacks and cold attacks.

Nature > Artifice: No amount of tech can stand up to the true force of Nature. Lightning will fry electronics, alternate cold and heat will break metals, crushing something between multiple tons of rock will break anything that otherwise refuses to be broken.
