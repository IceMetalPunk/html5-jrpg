"Gemini: Spawn of Castor" / "Gemini: Spawn of Pollux"

Every Spawn has both a tribe and a type. Types determine strengths and weaknesses, tribes determine main strategies. Every tribe can get every strategy of move, but they focus more on two strategies than others. Every type can get almost every other type of move, but they do get the equivalent of STAB for using same-type moves. A move has a type, but not a tribe, though the effects of the move may fit it into one tribe or another inherently.

Each spawn can wear up to 4 pieces of armor and have 1 or 2 held items; think of them as Minecraft equipment slots.

--------------------------

TRIBES:

Vampiric Tribe:
Primary focus: Draining Moves, stat lowering
Secondary focus: Conversion moves (whatever that means: swapping their spawn for yours? Changing types?)

Trickster Tribe:
Primary focus: Symmetric or random status moves (confusion, stat swapping, shuffling a team's position, etc.)
Secondary focus: Preaction moves (i.e. "becomes priority if opponent chooses a certain type of move")

Rogue Tribe:
Primary focus: Evasion moves (lower accuracy, raise stealth, invisibility, etc.)
Secondary focus: "Always hit" moves and moves that bypass protections

Militia Tribe:
Primary focus: Voltron - get extra buffs from armor and weapons
Secondary focus: Preplanning - Moves that allow you to sequence them two or more turns in advance

Support Tribe:
Primary focus: Healing and buffing (itself, allies, etc.)
Secondary focus: Protection effects, blocking opponent moves

-------------------

Types:
Mind, Body, Specter (supernatural creatures), Nature, Artifice, Arcane

Two non-transitive loops for balance:
Arcane > Specter > Mind > Arcane
Artifice > Nature > Body > Artifice

(Don't ask why Body > Artifice, I don't know, but it must be for mechanical balance!)
